The Genome Modeling System (GMS) **ALPHA**

A paper describing the GMS is under preparation.

Some of the tools made available through the GMS have been previously released as <a href="http://gmt.genome.wustl.edu/">Genome Modeling Tools</a>

The raw data and reference files needed for the tutorial below are made available through our <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/pub/software/gms/testdata/">FTP</a> and as an <a href="https://gmsdata.s3.amazonaws.com/">Amazon Public Dataset</a>

More detailed documentation and tutorials are available in the home page: <big><a href="https://github.com/genome/gms/wiki">GMS Home</a></big>
